//  #  Including Magento UI library to your theme
//
//  The lib.less file contains the includes of all Magento UI library files. To use Magento UI library in your theme add the following directive to the themeâ€™s styles.less:
//  ```css
//  @import "source/lib/lib.less";
//  ```
//  The lib.less file is designed to avoid manual adding of each Magento UI library file import instruction to your theme.
