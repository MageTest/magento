# Integration

**Integration** provides the ability for 3rd party services to call the Web API using access tokens.
It provides the UI to add an integration manually in the admin backend. Extensions can also provide a configuration
file so that an integration can be automatically pre-configured. The module also contains the data
model and management for request and access tokens.
