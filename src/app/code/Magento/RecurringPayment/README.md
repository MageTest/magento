The Magento_RecurringPayment module provides the ability to set and configure recurring payments on a product.
When a product is purchased from a store, the customer is redirected to a 3rd-party payment system where a "recurring payment agreement" with the store is signed/authorized by the customer.
A recurring payment agreement is an agreement between the customer and the store authorized by a payment system. In the payment system, this agreement authorizes the merchant to charge the customer account again in the future according to the recurring payment settings. These are called "recurring payments" in Magento. In the 3rd-party payment system, a recurring payment is an accounting record that captures payments on a regular basis and according to the payment schedule defined in the recurring payment.
